## FP Multiplier


Implement and test (synthesize, simulate and write a test-bench) for a Floating Point Multiplication that is capable of multiplying two single precision floating point numbers that follow IEEE 754. Simulate your circuit and write a test-bench to test it on different values. 
Use modular design by building small building blocks (modules) and then integrating it to make eh multiplier. On the side you are given a block diagram of the components of the multiplier.
